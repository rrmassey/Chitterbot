# Chitterbot - Your Friendly AI Chat Companion

Welcome to Chitterbot! This is a Node.js-based chatbot powered by the incredible capabilities of OpenAI's language models. Built using the foundations provided by OpenAI's GitHub repository, Chitterbot offers a conversational experience right from your terminal.

## Getting Started

Ready to chat? Here's how to get Chitterbot up and running:

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** Make sure you have Node.js and its package manager (npm is usually installed with Node.js) installed on your system. You can download them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:** If you have the Chitterbot project files in a repository, clone it to your local machine using Git:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd chitterbot
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the necessary Node.js packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Configuration: Obtaining and Setting Your OpenAI API Key

**Important:** To use Chitterbot, you will need your own OpenAI API key. Here's how to get one and configure it:

1.  **Sign up for an OpenAI account:** If you haven't already, create an account on the OpenAI platform at [https://platform.openai.com/](https://platform.openai.com/).

2.  **Generate a new API key:** Once you're logged in, navigate to the API keys section (usually under your profile settings). Click on the button to create a new secret key. **Treat this key with utmost secrecy!** Do not share it publicly or commit it directly to your code repository.

3.  **Create a `.env` file:** In the root directory of your Chitterbot project, create a new file named `.env`.

4.  **Add your API key to the `.env` file:** Open the `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key in the following format:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...your-openai-api-key...
    ```
    Replace `sk-...your-openai-api-key...` with your actual API key.

### Running Chitterbot

Once you have installed the dependencies and configured your API key, you can run Chitterbot using the following command in your terminal (from the project's root directory):

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
